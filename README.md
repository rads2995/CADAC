# HOPE: Highly Operational Programming Enviroment

Numerical simulation for state-space systems.

Various parameters can be modified in the src/main.cpp source file.

### Libraries
- Boost (odeint)
- Eigen (Core)

### Requirements
- CMake (build)

### Project Structure
- include/  (header files)
- lib/      (external libraries)
- python/   (python scripts, requires Numpy and Matplotlib)
- src/      (source code files)

### To-Do
- Read system's matrices and vectors from text file (in progress...)
- User can modify components of state matrices and vectors at runtime
- System's matrices and vectors can be resized at runtime
