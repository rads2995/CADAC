### Instructions

All files inside the <code>/data</code> directory utilize the file extension <code>.txt</code>.

You can open and edit each of these files during runtime.

The first line of each text file is reserved for the user to declare the number of rows followed by the number of columns.

For example, if you wish to define matrix [A], open the file <code>A.txt</code> and declare the dimensions in the first line.

This is how it should look for a 2 by 2 matrix with elements <code>A(0,0) = 1</code>, <code>A(0,1) = 2</code>, <code>A(1,0) = 3</code>, and <code>A(1,1) = 4</code>.
